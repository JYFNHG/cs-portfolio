            <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hello to anyone who reads this! My name is Chloe and this is a page where I'm gonna put a bit about me. First of all, I love foxes for no real particular reason. I just love the way they move and look! They're so admirably graceful and the way they run is hypnotizing. I do love all animals, however, another one of my favorites being dogs, German Shepards to be specific. Second, my favorite country is Italy! Despite not being Italian, at least to my knowledge, I adore it. The food is amazing, the buildings are charmingly old style, and I've heard the atmosphere is amazing! I still haven't gone there yet, but I would love to! I also want to travel to Germany, Ireland, China, and France. I'm Chinese, Irish, and German, so it's natural I'd want to visit the countries my blood is from right? I want to go to France because my grandma said I would love it there. I also like to do simple things like draw, listen to music, make things (sewing, baking, etc.) and I even write on occasion. I think that's it, so thanks for reading!</p>

            <h1>What I've learned</h1>
                <p> As of this Expeditions session, I have learned very basic coding. For example, in HTML which is the backbone of most if not all coding, I learned how to put text on a webpage like this and how to make headers like the one above that reads "What I've learned." I have also learned how to change the colors of things. For example, the navigation bar, or nav bar, at the top was changed green using CSS, which is the asspect of coding that allows color and image changes to a webpage. I used it also to add this super cool background and tound the egdes of the pictures I added!</p>
