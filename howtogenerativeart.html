        <h1>How to - Generative Art</h1>
        <p> For this project, I made a piece of art that, when clicked, will spawn black bear heads on one side and brown bear heads on the other side</p>

        <p> I first used an "if else" function to make it so that when I clicked, it made a bear appear where I clicked. I then used a a function I made titled "drawBear" to make a sort of function art with ellipses, which are used to make circles, and a line to make the mouth. Lastly, there's a small set of coding at the bottom. This is the main function that makes the bear drawn when the mouse is clicked, hence the "mouseClicked" at the beginning. The "(mouseX, mouseY)" makes it so that the function follows my mouse and can tell where I click.</p>

        <p>Next is the background. I used a loop. A loop is used to do just that, loop something. In this, I used it to loop many light green circles over a dark green background to make it look like a cartoony style patch of grass. The code at the top above the word </p>
