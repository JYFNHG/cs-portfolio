            <h1>How To - How did I make this page?</h1>
                <p> First, I'll start with something simple, how I centered my text. I simply used the "center" tag. Tags in HTML are the main mode of coding. Without them, you simply have text and a blank webpage.</p>
                    <img src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/GX48NfTpQbOxj6xfr1rIcg.png" width="400">
                <p> This centers anything between the first and second "center" tag. The ending "center" tag looks like "/center". Without it, the center tag you added will do nothing to your text.</p> <br>
                <p> Second, I'm going to introduce CSS with how I rounded the corners of my pictures. First, I opened a CSS file. This allows me to add color or stylization to anything from the background to the text if I link it to my original file with the code "link rel="stylesheet" href="navbar.css" type="text/css" /". </p>
                    <img src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/H3qtGqKgRAS2zFzrrBNeUw.png">
                <p> Next, I inserted an image with the tag "img src=". It stands for "image source," which means you can add in any image off the internet. However, it doesn't let you add in images from your personal computer because it doesn't have a link to source back to. I then added a "class" to the images. Classes let you catagorize your coding to add CSS to it. For the first images, I gave them the class of "foximage."</p>
                    <img src="https://image.prntscr.com/image/H3qtGqKgRAS2zFzrrBNeUw.png">
                <p>Then, I went into my CSS file and and typed in ".foximage {" This connects the css file to the images and lets me edit them. If they have the same class, it also lets me edit them both at once.</p>

                <p> The left curly bracket automatically makes a right one. In between those is where you put your desired code. In my case, the code was "border radius," which changes the radius of the image. I adjusted the "px" which stands for pixels, until the border got to a rounded shape that I liked. I did this because the shapr edges of the picture aren't incredebly appealing to the eye, so making the edges of the picture softer makes the pictures not only more appealing but also more engaging to the audience looking at it.</p><br>
                <p>The last thing I want to show is how I made the navigation bar, or "nav bar" for short. The first thing I did </p>
